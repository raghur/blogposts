I've been a markdown user almost exclusively - more due to github and stackoverflow popularizing the format. Markdown
is great for lightweight markup and with excellent tools like Pandoc, it's a joy to produce good looking technical docs.
Suffice to say that I've been taken with markdown and even use it to produce word documents and such. 

While Markdown is great, it has it's share of niggles - try to go beyond the basics and want some advanced features and
you get into trouble. Want tables? Or want to include diagrams generated from ascii art? It's all a hit or miss depending
on which Markdown implementation  you're using. Ditto for things like nested lists and lists with sub paras and whole lot 
of other niggles where each different Markdown implementation may end up behaving differently. There have been some efforts
to have a rigourous spec but I don't think things went anywhere with http://CommonMark.org[CommonMark] - atleast, I don't 
see it used much anywhere.

For the latter problem of wanting to include diagrams, I wrote https://github.com/raghur/mermaid-filter[mermaid-filter]
and while it's super useful, it works only with https://github.com/knsv/mermaid[mermaid]. If you want to use `graphviz`
or something like that, sorry - you're out of luck.

I've resigned myself to Pandoc's version of markdown - since I end up using pandoc almost always to convert to other formats.

Wanting a better lightweight markup format, I spent sometime looking at alternatives this weekend and came upon 
`asciidoc` - and I'm just wowed! It pretty much ticks all the boxes in terms of all the niggles I have with Markdown 
and it's not so different from markdown either so that transitioning to AsciiDoc is a non issue.

AsciiDoc has the following over Markdown:

. Supports advanced formatting natively.
.. http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#source-code-blocks[Native code formatting] with pluggable syntax highlighters.
.. http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#callouts[code call outs] - oh so useful.
.. http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#xref[Cross references]
.. http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#tables[Tables]
. Rigourous spec
. Smart, natively extensible
.. For ex: want diagrams? A http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoctor-diagram/#creating-a-diagram[whole bunch are supported]

It's miles ahead of Markdown, IMO - so much so that I'm jumping ship :)

So, in a rush of enthusiasm, I've updated https://github.com/raghur/easyblogger[EasyBlogger] with `asciidoc` 
support and pushed a release out to PyPI. This also means that I would probably not need 
https://github.com/raghur/mermaid-filter[mermaid-filter] anymore - but hey, you should see better looking posts from 
me here.
