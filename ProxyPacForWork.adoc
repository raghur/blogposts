Proxy pac file to switch proxy based on whether I'm connected to OpenVPN or not.

Basically, OpenVPN IP is 10.8.0.6 and at home I have 192.168.1.xxx - so if either of those two are available, then I bypass
proxy.

Put it someplace and in IE configure it with a `file://` url

I really, really hate our proxy configuration at work!

Also, proxy pac file support is really arcane... however, it does work without additional configuration/addons - so there's that.
