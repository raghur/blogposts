### Weekend with Yeoman

So it started with a post on reddit (something that I spend too much time on.) about an interactive Angular JS tutorial.
It's been some time since I played with Angular and decided to spend some time on it. One website led to another and I
eventually got around to [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io). So ended up digging into Yeoman a lot more than anything else. Given our status at work building
[brewmaster](http://brewmaster.aditicloud.com) and [scheduler](http://www.aditicloud.com), and our architecture where the front end
is just consuming REST services, we might be able to move to a pure Nodejs front end. The ever present question of course is
doing a rewrite vs adding features!!!

Anyway, plan to spend some more time with Yeoman and friends and on Angular too.

Hey - and did I mention - I also flew kites with my kids - awesome fun! Brought back my childhood memories of running around
the streets of Lucknow trying to catch kites!
